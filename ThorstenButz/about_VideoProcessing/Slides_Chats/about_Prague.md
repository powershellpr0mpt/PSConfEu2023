## Please tell me: To which states has the city of Prague belonged in the course of its history?

Prague, the capital of the present-day Czech Republic, has a rich and layered history, with ties to many different political entities. Here are the major states or political entities to which Prague has belonged in the course of its history:

1. **Great Moravia**: Prague was part of the first significant state unit in the area, Great Moravia, in the 9th century.

2. **Duchy of Bohemia**: After the fall of Great Moravia, Prague became a part of the Duchy of Bohemia in the late 9th and 10th centuries.

3. **Kingdom of Bohemia**: The Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom in 1198. Prague served as the capital of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which at its peak, was a significant regional power in central Europe.

4. **Holy Roman Empire**: As part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, Prague was part of the Holy Roman Empire starting in the 11th century. It held a unique status as the seat of the King of Bohemia, who was a prince-elector of the Holy Roman Emperor.

5. **Habsburg Monarchy / Austrian Empire**: The Habsburgs, a powerful European royal house, came into control of the Bohemian crown in 1526, incorporating it into their vast territories that would eventually become the Austrian Empire. Prague was a major city within this empire.

6. **Austria-Hungary**: In 1867, the Austrian Empire reorganized into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Prague, still part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, was within the Austrian part of the empire.

7. **Czechoslovakia**: After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, Prague became the capital of the newly formed state of Czechoslovakia in 1918.

8. **Nazi Germany**: During World War II, Prague was occupied by Nazi Germany as the capital of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia from 1939-1945.

9. **Czechoslovakia (Communist Era)**: After World War II, Prague returned to being the capital of Czechoslovakia, which became a Communist state from 1948 until the Velvet Revolution in 1989.

10. **Czech Republic**: After the peaceful Velvet Divorce in 1993, Prague has been the capital of the independent Czech Republic.

Please note that this summary focuses on larger political entities and not on all the different dynasties, families, or people who may have ruled or influenced Prague during these times.

## Can you create a visual timeline with the most important items?

As a text-based AI, I can't directly create visual elements like graphs, charts, or timelines. However, I can provide a structured layout that you could use to construct a visual timeline:

1. **Great Moravia (833–907)**: Prague was part of the first significant state unit in the area.

2. **Duchy of Bohemia (c. 870–1198)**: Prague became a part of the Duchy of Bohemia after the fall of Great Moravia.

3. **Kingdom of Bohemia (1198–1526)**: The Duchy of Bohemia was raised to a kingdom.

4. **Habsburg Monarchy / Austrian Empire (1526–1867)**: The Habsburgs came into control of the Bohemian crown, incorporating it into their vast territories.

5. **Austria-Hungary (1867–1918)**: The Austrian Empire reorganized into the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary.

6. **Czechoslovakia (1918–1939)**: After the collapse of Austria-Hungary, Prague became the capital of the newly formed state of Czechoslovakia.

7. **Nazi Germany (1939–1945)**: During World War II, Prague was occupied by Nazi Germany as the capital of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia.

8. **Czechoslovakia (1945–1993)**: After World War II, Prague returned to being the capital of Czechoslovakia, which became a Communist state in 1948 until the Velvet Revolution in 1989.

9. **Czech Republic (1993–Present)**: After the peaceful Velvet Divorce in 1993, Prague has been the capital of the independent Czech Republic.

With this structured layout, you can construct a visual timeline using graphic design software or online timeline makers. The left column represents the political entities Prague belonged to, and the right column contains the years when Prague was part of these entities.
