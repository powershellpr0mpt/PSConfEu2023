## How can I get an API key for Youtube? 

Getting an API key for YouTube involves several steps and requires you to have a Google account. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Google Cloud Console**: Go to the Google Cloud Console (console.cloud.google.com) and sign in with your Google account.

2. **Create a new project**: Click on the project drop-down and select `New Project`. Provide a name for your project, and optionally, you can also edit the Project ID. Click on `Create` to create the new project.

3. **Enable YouTube Data API v3**: Once the project is created, you will be directed to the Project Dashboard. Click on `Go to APIs overview` and then click on `Enable APIs and Services`. In the search bar, search for `YouTube Data API v3` and click on it. In the new page, click on `Enable` to enable the API for your project.

4. **Create credentials**: After the API is enabled, click on `Create Credentials` on the right side of the screen. In the `Which API are you using?` drop-down, select `YouTube Data API v3`. For `Where will you be calling the API from?`, select the relevant option (usually `Web server (e.g., node.js, Tomcat)` if you're going to use it on a server, or `Web browser (JavaScript)` if it's client-side). Then select `Public data` under `What data will you be accessing?`. Then click `Next`.

5. **API key**: Now, you should be presented with an API key. Copy this key and store it in a safe place. 

Remember that this API key is linked with your Google account, so it's crucial that you keep it secure. Do not share it publicly, as it could be used to perform actions that could potentially cost you money, depending on the services accessed.

Also, note that as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, this is the process to get a YouTube API key. However, Google may change their interface or process, so you may need to look up up-to-date information if you encounter any discrepancies.

## Where do I find my youtube channel ID?

To find your YouTube channel ID, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. Sign in to your YouTube account.

2. Click on your profile icon in the top-right corner of the screen.

3. From the dropdown menu, click on `Settings`.

4. In the left-hand column, click `Advanced settings`.

5. Your User ID and Channel ID are listed towards the bottom of this page.

Please remember to never share your channel ID publicly, as it could potentially be used maliciously.

As of my last update in September 2021, this is the current method of finding your YouTube channel ID. However, YouTube may update their interface or process over time, so please refer to the most current resources if necessary.



## Can you translate this curl command to PowerShell's Invoke-Restmethod?

`curl "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?key=YOUR_API_KEY&channelId=YOUR_CHANNEL_ID&part=snippet,id&order=date&maxResults=20`



Sure! Here's how you might translate the given `curl` command to PowerShell using the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet:

```powershell
$Uri = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search"
$ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
$ChannelId = "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
$Params = @{
    key = $ApiKey
    channelId = $ChannelId
    part = "snippet,id"
    order = "date"
    maxResults = "20"
}

$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $Uri -Method Get -Body $Params

# The $response variable now holds the data returned from the API.
```

This script sets up a hashtable of parameters to send with the `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet. You will need to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" and "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID" with your actual API key and Channel ID.

Note: Invoke-RestMethod automatically converts JSON responses to PowerShell objects, so you can access properties directly. For example, to access items you can use: `$response.items`. If the response is in XML, PowerShell will convert it into a XML Document Object Model (DOM).



## Can you modify the command so that I do get a list of my published videos and numbers of visitors?

Unfortunately, the YouTube Data API doesn't provide direct video view count information in the search endpoint response. However, you can use the `videoId` from the search endpoint response to make another request to the videos endpoint, which includes statistics like view count.

Here is a script for PowerShell which retrieves the `videoId` from a channel's recently published videos, then makes a request for each video to the videos endpoint to get the view count.

Please replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"` with your actual API Key and Channel ID.

```powershell
$UriSearch = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search"
$UriVideo = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos"
$ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
$ChannelId = "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"
$ParamsSearch = @{
    key = $ApiKey
    channelId = $ChannelId
    part = "snippet"
    order = "date"
    maxResults = "20"  # modify as needed
}

$responseSearch = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $UriSearch -Method Get -Body $ParamsSearch

$videoList = @() 

foreach ($item in $responseSearch.items) {
    $ParamsVideo = @{
        key = $ApiKey
        id = $item.id.videoId
        part = "statistics"
    }

    $responseVideo = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $UriVideo -Method Get -Body $ParamsVideo
    $videoList += New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        VideoId = $item.id.videoId
        VideoTitle = $item.snippet.title
        ViewCount = $responseVideo.items.statistics.viewCount
    }
}

$videoList
```

In this script, `$videoList` will be an array of PowerShell objects. Each object in the array represents a video, containing the `VideoId`, `VideoTitle`, and `ViewCount`.

Again, please note that you will need to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"` with your actual YouTube API Key and Channel ID.

Also, please be aware of the YouTube API's quota usage. Each API call consumes quota, and if you exceed the quota limit, you will receive an error message from the YouTube API until your quota is reset. If necessary, you can request an increased quota from the Google Cloud Console.

## Can you modify the script so that it displays the number of published videos?

Yes, certainly! The simplest way to get the number of published videos is to count the items returned by your search request, assuming that the number of videos is less than or equal to your `maxResults` value. 

However, if you have more than `maxResults` number of videos in your channel (20 in the example provided), the count of videos will not be accurate as it is limited by the `maxResults` parameter. In this case, you need to use the channel's endpoint to get the total number of public videos.

Here's an updated script that uses the channels endpoint to get the total number of public videos:

```powershell
$UriSearch = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search"
$UriChannel = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels"
$ApiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
$ChannelId = "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"

$ParamsChannel = @{
    key = $ApiKey
    id = $ChannelId
    part = "statistics"
}

$responseChannel = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $UriChannel -Method Get -Body $ParamsChannel
$videoCount = $responseChannel.items.statistics.videoCount

Write-Output "Total number of published videos: $videoCount"
```

In this script, `$videoCount` will hold the total number of published videos on your channel. Please remember to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` and `"YOUR_CHANNEL_ID"` with your actual YouTube API Key and Channel ID. 

This gives you the total number of public videos on the channel, it won't include private or unlisted videos.



## I created a variable $API_KEY that contains the API_Key and another variable $CHANNEL_ID that contains the CHANNEL_ID. Can you update the script?

Sure, if you already have the variables `$API_KEY` and `$CHANNEL_ID` defined, you can use them directly in the script. Here's how your updated script should look:

```powershell
$UriChannel = "https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/channels"

$ParamsChannel = @{
    key = $API_KEY
    id = $CHANNEL_ID
    part = "statistics"
}

$responseChannel = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $UriChannel -Method Get -Body $ParamsChannel
$videoCount = $responseChannel.items.statistics.videoCount

Write-Output "Total number of published videos: $videoCount"
```

In this script, `$videoCount` will hold the total number of published videos on your channel. The script uses the previously defined `$API_KEY` and `$CHANNEL_ID` variables. This will output the total number of public videos on the channel; it won't include private or unlisted videos.
