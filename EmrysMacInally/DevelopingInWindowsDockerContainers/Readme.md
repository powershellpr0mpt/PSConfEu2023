# Developing in Windows Docker Containers

VSCode Dev Containers can greatly improve your coding experience by providing an isolated environment with only the dependencies you need, without the clutter of unnecessary modules and other junk on your local machine. Unfortunately, VSCode Dev Containers are currently Linux only. If you are, like me, bound to Windows or PowerShell 5.1, you are unable to use the benefits of Dev Containers.
But what if you could create a Windows container with similar capabilities for development? In this session, weâ€™ll explore the benefits of container development, walk through the process of building and configuring a Windows container with PowerShell 7, OpenSSH, vscode-server, VSCode extensions and how to use them in your daily work.
This session is aimed at Windows admins with little to no prior knowledge of Docker.
