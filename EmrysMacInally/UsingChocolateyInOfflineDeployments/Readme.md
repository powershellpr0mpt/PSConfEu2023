# Using Chocolatey in offline deployments

Are you aware of Chocolatey's capabilities beyond just being a package manager? With Chocolatey, you can create a single package that includes all the binaries, scripts, and modules you need for a complex offline deployment. This makes it easy to distribute a package to servers and deploy it, even when the target is offline. Plus, you can use a few simple techniques to add parameter validation and interactive debugging to your packages, simplifying the installation process for colleagues and customers.
During this session, we'll go through the process of packaging your binaries, scripts, and modules, and discuss how to use parameter validation to reduce errors. We'll also delve into how to debug Chocolatey package installations and install our package without access to a repository.
